# My Linux PC

Enjoy some pics & diagrams on my custom Ubuntu machine and everything I've done with it!

### Atlas Node

This documentation is also inside the `doc` project of the Atlas Node group.

The Atlas Node group is comprised of many IaaS projects in which I use my 
personal Desktop in my office to lay down infrastructure on my Ubuntu machine 
over SSH, which runs in my basement with no screens or keyboards plugged into it.

The Ubuntu machine is essentially a Linux server, and the Atlas Node is all of the 
infrastructure I've laid down on it.
